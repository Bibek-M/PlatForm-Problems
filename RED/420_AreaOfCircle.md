# 420. Area Of Circle

🟡 **Difficulty:** Easy

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given the radius of a circle, your task is to compute its area.

The area (A) of a circle is calculated using the formula:

[ A=π×r2 ]

Where:

r: Radius of the circle.
(π): A mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14.
Your implementation should take the radius as input and return the computed area.

Your program should take the radius as input and return the calculated area with a precision of up to two decimal places.

#### Example:
Input:


radius = 5
Output:


78.54
Explanation:

Given the radius of 5, the area ( A = \pi \times 5^2 = 78.53975 ) is rounded to 78.54.
