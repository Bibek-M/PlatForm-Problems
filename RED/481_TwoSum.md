# 481. Two Sum

🟡 **Difficulty:** Easy

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, your task is to find two numbers in the array such that their sum is equal to the target. You need to return the indices of these two numbers. Make sure that you do not use the same element twice in contributing to the sum.

You are guaranteed that there will be exactly one unique solution. The order in which you return the indices does not matter.

## 📌 Examples

### 🔹 Example 1

```
Input:

nums=[2,7,11,15] target=9

Output:

0, 1
Explanation:2 + 7 = 9, and their indices are 0 and 1
```

### 🔹 Example 2

```
Input:

nums=[3,2,4] target=6

Output:

1, 2
Explanation:2 + 4 = 6, hence indices 1 and 2
```

### 🔹 Example 3

```
Input:

nums=[3,3] target=6

Output:

0, 1
Explanation:3 + 3 = 6, so the pair is 0 and 1
```

## 📝 Note

- :
- Consider scenarios where the array is of size 2 or contains negative numbers as potential edge cases.

## ⚙️ Constraints

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10`
- `-10`
- `-10`
- `There is only one valid answer.`
- `You may not use the same element twice.`
