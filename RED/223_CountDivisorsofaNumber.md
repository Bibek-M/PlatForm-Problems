# 223. Count Divisors of a Number

🟡 **Difficulty:** Medium

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer num. Your task is to find the count of its divisors. A divisor is any integer that divides num without leaving a remainder. For example, if num = 6, its divisors are 1, 2, 3, and 6, so the count of divisors is 4.

#### Example:
Input:

num = 12
Output:


6
Explanation: Divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Hence, the number of divisors is 6.

Input:

Input: num = 2

Output:

2
Explanation:2 has two divisors: 1 and 2.
```

### 🔹 Example 3

```
Input:

Input: num = 4

Output:

3
Explanation:4 has three divisors: 1, 2, 4.
```
