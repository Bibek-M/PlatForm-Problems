🟡 **Difficulty:** Easy

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Your task is to write a program that determines the sign of a given integer. The integer, denoted as num, can fall into three categories: positive, negative, or zero. The objective is to output a string that signifies the sign of the number.

Output "Positive" if the integer is greater than zero.
Output "Negative" if the integer is less than zero.
Output "Zero" if the integer is exactly zero.
This problem requires basic understanding of conditional statements to determine the category in which the number falls. Ensure that your solution efficiently handles all possible integer inputs within the specified range.
