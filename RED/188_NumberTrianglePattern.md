# 188. Number Triangle Pattern

🟡 **Difficulty:** Easy

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given an integer n, your task is to print a triangle pattern of numbers. The triangle should consist of n rows, where each row i contains the number i, repeated i times.

The sequence starts from the number 1 at the top, and each subsequent row increments the number value by one, building up the triangle until row n.

#### Example
For an input n = 5, the printed output should be:

```
1
22
333
4444
55555
```
The first row contains the number 1, repeated once.
The second row contains the number 2, repeated twice, and so on, up to row n.
