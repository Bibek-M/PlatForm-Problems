# 205. Print Number Multiple Times

🟡 **Difficulty:** Easy

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

In this problem, you are required to develop a program that takes two integers as input: num and n. Your task is to print the integer num exactly n times on a single line, where each occurrence of num is separated by a space.

This simple program involves receiving inputs for num (the number to be printed) and n (the count indicating how many times num should appear). You need to ensure the numbers are printed in the correct format on one line.

Example
Suppose you receive the following input:

num = 3
n = 5
Your program should output:


3 3 3 3 3
Here, the number 3 is printed five times, with each occurrence separated by a single space.

## 📌 Examples

### 🔹 Example 1

```
Input:

Input: num = 5, n = 3

Output:

5 5 5
Explanation:The number 5 is printed 3 times.
```

### 🔹 Example 2

```
Input:

Input: num = -2, n = 4

Output:

-2 -2 -2 -2
Explanation:The number -2 is printed 4 times.
```

### 🔹 Example 3

```
Input:

Input: num = 7, n = 1

Output:

7
Explanation:The number 7 is printed 1 time.
```
