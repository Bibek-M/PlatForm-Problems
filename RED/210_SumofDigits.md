🟡 **Difficulty:** Easy

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

You are required to write a function that calculates the sum of the digits of a given non-negative integer num. This task aims to enhance your understanding of basic numerical operations, which are fundamental to developing algorithmic logic. The function should return a single integer, which is the sum of all digits present in the input number. The integer num will be in the range from 0 to 1 billion inclusive. This means your function must be efficient enough to handle large numbers within this range.

## 📌 Examples

### 🔹 Example 1

```
Input:


num = 12345
Output:


15
Explanation:

The individual digits of the number 12345 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Their sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.
```

### 🔹 Example 2

```
Input:


num = 0
Output:


0
Explanation:

The only digit here is 0, so the sum is 0.
```

### 🔹 Example 3

```
Input:

Input: num = 123

Output:

6
Explanation:Sum of 1, 2, and 3 is 6.
```

### 🔹 Example 4

```
Input:

Input: num = 456

Output:

15
Explanation:Sum of 4, 5, and 6 is 15.
```

### 🔹 Example 5

```
Input:

Input: num = 0

Output:

0
Explanation:Sum of digits in 0 is 0.
```
