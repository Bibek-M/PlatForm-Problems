# 206. Print Counting from 1 to N

🟡 **Difficulty:** Easy

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given an integer n, your task is to write a function that generates a list of integers from 1 to n and prints them in a single line, with each number separated by a space.

Example:
Input:


5
Output:


1 2 3 4 5
The function should efficiently loop through numbers starting from 1 to n and ensure that the printed line has exactly one space between consecutive numbers with no trailing spaces after the last number.
