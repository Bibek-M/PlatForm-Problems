## 🧠 Calculate the Area of a Rectangle


In this problem, your task is to write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle. You will be given two integer inputs: the length and breadth of the rectangle. Your program should compute the area using these inputs and output the result.

The area of a rectangle can be determined with the formula:

[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Breadth} ]

Example:
Suppose you are given the following inputs:

Length: 4
Breadth: 5
The area of the rectangle would be calculated as follows:

[ \text{Area} = 4 \times 5 = 20 ]

So, the output will be 20.

## 📌 Examples

### 🔹 Example 1

```
Input:

Input: length = 5, breadth = 10

Output:

50
Explanation:The area of a rectangle with length 5 and breadth 10 is 5 * 10 = 50.
```

### 🔹 Example 2

```
Input:

Input: length = 20, breadth = 30

Output:

600
Explanation:The area of a rectangle with length 20 and breadth 30 is 20 * 30 = 600.
```

### 🔹 Example 3

```
Input:

Input: length = 100, breadth = 200

Output:

20000
Explanation:The area of a rectangle with length 100 and breadth 200 is 100 * 200 = 20000.
```
