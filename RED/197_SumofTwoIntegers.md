## 🧠 Sum of Two Integers


In this problem, you are required to implement a program that takes two integers as inputs and computes their sum. This basic arithmetic problem will help you understand how to handle inputs and outputs effectively in programming, alongside performing simple arithmetic operations like addition.

Input
Two integers, a and b.
Output
An integer which is the sum of a and b.
Example
Example 1
Input: 3, 7
Output: 10
Example 2
Input: -234, 127
Output: -107
The task is simple: read the inputs, calculate their sum, and print the result. Let this problem serve as an introduction to working with basic arithmetic and input/output operations.
